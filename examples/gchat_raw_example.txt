AL, Yesterday 10:48 AM
oh yeah by the wya
i saw the climbing club insta
you guys prob don't wanna put everyone's names in the bio
and should consider making the insta public
so that it gets advertised more easily
just a short bio of what the club is about is enough

AL, Yesterday 10:54 AM
oh yeah also make sure to put lahs somewhere in the title
so that people know its a school club

AT, Yesterday 11:29 AM
ik A we arent allowed to make any public ads without asking school
and since we havent chartered the club yet
we arent allowed to put lahs in it yet

AL, Yesterday 11:31 AM
my b
you might wanna take a look at other club bios tho
just for  easier marketing

AT, Yesterday 11:32 AM
ik we dont have anything yet so that's why i just put that in bio for now

AL, Yesterday 11:33 AM
alr

AT, Yesterday 11:33 AM
but yeah we are gonna like change everything after we charter club

AL, Yesterday 11:33 AM

DP, Yesterday 12:46 PM
Rip

AL, Yesterday 12:47 PM
i don't even know what the point of all that skincare of when he got no bitches
at his school

AT, Yesterday 12:47 PM
wdym why would you not want to have nice skin

AL, Yesterday 12:47 PM
ok having nice skin is great
but having nice skin with benefits
is better
and like when everyone looks like they came out the prehistoric times out of you
no point looking like the shining angel
in a school of cavemen
you get what i mean?

AT, Yesterday 12:48 PM
yeah lOL
but no one looks in the mirror and says i want to have acne

AL, Yesterday 12:48 PM
i mean
no one rlly wants to go thru
4am rituals of doing skincare tho either

AT, Yesterday 12:50 PM
i like doing skincare tho

AL, Yesterday 12:50 PM
ok A i think thats just you LMAO

AT, Yesterday 12:50 PM
its like self care and also wakes me up in the morning

AL, Yesterday 12:50 PM

AT, Yesterday 12:51 PM
ohh like you cant spend time doing skincare you mean?

AL, Yesterday 12:51 PM
yeah

AT, Yesterday 12:51 PM
skincare takes me like <5 minutes tho

AL, Yesterday 12:51 PM
i'd rather be doing skincare than practicing
but sadge
but the good thing is
if i practice one hour in the morning
i only have to practice 3 hours during the day
which is great
because before my mom was like
practice as long as you can
but now
🙂
i have a limit
why did i think id meet like 70 new friends in hs instantly
i feel like i made a total of 3 new friends
this is so sad

AT, Yesterday 12:57 PM
its only been like 2 months dw A
you have plenty of time

DP, Yesterday 12:58 PM
Dang rip

DP, Yesterday 1:01 PM
Mr Sproule told us even teachers cut in line LOL

AL, Yesterday 1:01 PM

DP, Yesterday 1:01 PM
He said he didn’t wanna name names

AL, Yesterday 1:01 PM
except for lunch
when im in the pizza line

DP, Yesterday 1:01 PM
But teachers def cut

AL, Yesterday 1:01 PM
lol

DP, Yesterday 1:01 PM
I never get piZza
I’m healthy like that

AL, Yesterday 1:01 PM
yeah i wouldn't get it by first choice either
i get it when the line's too long and i wanna grab something fast

DP, Yesterday 1:01 PM
Anything from the cafeteria is better tho
Yeah it sucks when ppl just come up to u to cut u

AL, Yesterday 1:02 PM
dude hot lunch just sucks
cold lunch is pretty decent

DP, Yesterday 1:02 PM
But usually I haven’t talked to them in a while

AL, Yesterday 1:02 PM
yeah it does but life is life ig

DP, Yesterday 1:02 PM
So it’s nice to catch up with them

AL, Yesterday 1:02 PM
how do you carry on a convo
things get awkward so fast

DP, Yesterday 1:02 PM
I don’t get the chicken sandwiches
Nah for me it doesn’t really
U can talked about anything really

AL, Yesterday 1:03 PM

That’s a big rip
Yeah truw
I think it’s unfair

AL, Yesterday 1:04 PM
why are the expectatoins so high
its so annoying

DP, Yesterday 1:04 PM
They discriminate grades against slow people
That’s unfair

AL, Yesterday 1:05 PM
like we're not even going to become track stars

DP, Yesterday 1:05 PM
I love mr huynh

AL, Yesterday 1:05 PM
i still have that grudge against mr huynh for listening to my sister's performance than leaving during the middle of mine
but like

DP, Yesterday 1:05 PM
Then u can get it

AL, Yesterday 1:05 PM

DP, Yesterday 1:05 PM

DP, Yesterday 1:08 PM
That’s the spirit

AL, Yesterday 1:08 PM
yep
the book of unkown americans is rlly funny
from mayor's perspective

DP, Yesterday 1:09 PM
It’s depressing
Everyone has a depressing life story

AT, Yesterday 1:14 PM
nah D i tried and got 4:20
raffo gives 10/10 for girls if you get 4:20
boys is 4

DP, Yesterday 1:22 PM
Oh what
So u barely made it?
That makes no sense
Bc u have like 8-9 min mile
So u should be way faster
It’s not supposed to be half
Bc ur half mile should be way faster than ur mile divided by 2
Since u can sprint

AL, Yesterday 1:49 PM
