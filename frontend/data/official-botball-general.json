Then the new members got split up into teams and competed against each other.\n\nIf I was a teacher doing a robotics class I would probably design periodic challenges with them and use that as assignments/extra credit for the class.\n\nIf you do implement a pre-season, I would recommend trying very hard to make the team leader(s) understand that they should choose who gets in based on effort and not on skill. Skill based selection got out of hand and evolved into a toxic learning environment (it also defeats the point of botball, which is to give students skills). When my generation became leaders we switched to effort based and had new members sign a behavior contract, the bullying issues seemed to have stopped.",

I think your logic is correct. if you assume that each cube that touches black tape is a bottommost **item ** (as you mentioned) in a stack then each of those constitutes the possible start of a stack and thus a separate scoring area. Therefore any cube that touches the top of it can be a part of it's stack. Although a stack is not sorted if there are two cubes on top of one where at least one is not the same color as one of the one below it. So examples below:\n\nSorted:   GR       G        R\n                 GR      G       GR\n\nNot Sorted:    GR      R\n                          G       G",

I think <@825137715309314058> mentioned a while back a similar situation but looking at the rules again I'd say if a cube on top of another is touching a cube below it that is not of the same color it would not count as sorted.\n\nThis is because since in the stacking rule we say items score in a stack if the bottommost item is touching the topmost surface above it and we speak of each** level** in a stack not each cube which would imply you can have more than one cube on a level in a stack and so one cube could break the sort in a stack since the stack is functionally the \"area\" that sort rule is being applied to.",

Cubes can cause a transporter to be sorted but still score on the black tape lines. So if we are applying similar reasoning here, Botguy can score and sort the transporter but also multiply things on the side, he just can't score in both areas.

The whole point of the rule is we are trying to provide as even of a playing field as possible for teams. Most teams do not have a welder nor know how to weld and so we would not allow it as something that teams could do.\n\nA good example of this is that we have been deliberating allowing 3D printing for several years but our main obstacle is whether or not most teams have ready access to one so that they can rapidly test and create new designs. One test of this in the past has been the CAD design competitions we have thrown out but no one has ever participated which is somewhat of an indicator to us that most teams don't have one or its something they haven't tested or considered much. So we continue to delay it until we see more teams wanting it.",

I'm guessing our due date will probably be sometime around 20-24th of June so that we can get the presentation titles printed, and get feedback to the selected presenters shortly after so that they can make edits and a final version back.\n\nWe are accepting a variety of presentation types this year ranging from technical papers, pieces of curriculum, or even video tutorials which could potentially be turned into workshops for GCER.",

Align one coupler to an edge of the acrylic that is laying flat on a surface and center the edge of the acrylic along the center of length of the coupler.\n2. Then using one piece of tape, attach the coupler to the acrylic. \n3. Repeat this for the other 3 couplers.\n4. Flip the assembly over, the acrylic will still be wobbly on the couplers.\n5. Realign the acrylic edge so it is once again centered on the length of a coupler and apply a piece of tape, making sure that the tape does not leave much room for the coupler to move.\n6. Repeat this for the other 3 couplers, adding additional tape as needed at the end to make sure it doesn't wobble too much.",

        "content": "The problem is that the way you calculate an accurate battery percentage in a device like a phone is by creating what is a called a battery discharge curve. However, the curve is slightly different even between two seemingly identical batteries from the same manufacturer. The way your smartphone gets around that is by updating it's battery discharge curve with new data that it collects while running normally. That is why sometimes you can make your phone have a more accurate percentage by making it drain itself completely dead from 100% and then charging it back to 100%.\n\nOur controller has a battery discharge curve model that is used in the percentage shown, but there is no way to implement active adjustment because the battery is swapped so often. Additionally the current charge is calculated on the current voltage from the battery. When the battery has a significant load such as motors, the voltage will drop giving the Wombat an incorrect battery level. There are ways we could implement a more accurate reading, but it would add significant cost and the goal of botball is to get as many students involved as possible.",

You responsed to this question that both multipliers are applied and it's actually a multiplier of x6 in total.\n\nThe other question was if the same rule counts for the Air Lock. We asked if both the \"sorted\" and \"both sides sorted\" multipliers are applied and if it's a total multiplier of x8 for the Air Lock. You responded that only one multiplier gets applied, contradicting your previous answer. \n\nWhat is correct now?

Every so often a team will come to me with this problem, but I've never had it happen to me and I haven't been able to recreate it in the lab so I'm not sure what I can recommend to avoid it. \n\nMy best guess is that users are turning off their Wombat (or their battery dies) while the Wombat is accessing the SD card (compiling, creating programs, etc). \nThat's why we tell people to use the shutdown button, even though most of the time it's not going to matter if you just flip the switch.\n\nTo fix the problem you will have to swap or rewrite your SD card.\nYour options are:\n- Send it in and have us swap the SD card for you (dm me, email support@kipr.org, or email me directly at zsasser@kipr.org to set that up)\n- Take the SD card out and follow some instructions I have and rewrite the image yourself (requires an SD reader, but isn't very difficult)\n\nThe bad news is that you have lost any programs that were on that Wombat.",

KIPR will not be hosting a competition this fall, however if teams decide to get together and host a skirmish, virtually or in person. We will try to support these if we can, however the fall is a busy time for prep for us and so our availability will be dependent on that. If you need help with documents for organizing a skirmish or brackets or similar we can definitely help with those.\n\nTeams that have already registered and had parts of their kits sent to them will have received some of the game pieces for this year and good things to do on this table may be to practice making things to pick up those pieces or methods of sorting them or stacking.",

Then Screw the motor module back into the Create using the brass screws.\n\nThis will effectively make the Create ignore the wheel sensors, and since I can't think of a reason why someone would ever use the wheel drop functions in botball it shouldn't cause any issues.",

If there are multiple boxes, send a screenshot to me so I can tell you which one to shrink.\n\nYou will have to pick a size to shrink to, you will want/have to pick a number larger than the amount of data you have on the drive already.\n(ie, if you have 120GB/1TB, you shrink it to like 200GB or more)\n\nAfter that, when you are going through the setup process, Ubuntu will ask you at some point to pick a drive, and setup partitions.\nYou will want to choose the option that says something along the lines of \"setup my own partitions\" or whatever (just don't use \"guided\" or \"automatic\")\nThen make a new partition by clicking on \"free space\" and \"+\", \"add\", etc.\nMake the mount point \"/\"\nMake the file system \"ext4\"\nYou can choose to use all that free space, or leave some extra space for \"Swap Area\" (that the computer can use for better performance). \n\nIt's also good to have Swap, which is space the computer can use for performance stuff.\nIt's best to make the swap partition at least 2 times the amount of RAM that you have.\nFor the rest of the free space you reserved, turn it into a swap partition (select \"swap area\" instead of \"ext4\" or \"fat32\" as the filesystem)\n\nAfter that, the setup should be just reading prompts with what you want (I think it is just basic \"new computer\" setup after that)\n\nHere are guides that explains the process step by step:\nEasy but won't give *peak* performance: https://www.tecmint.com/install-ubuntu-alongside-with-windows/\nA little more complicated: https://itsfoss.com/install-ubuntu-dual-boot-mode-windows/",
