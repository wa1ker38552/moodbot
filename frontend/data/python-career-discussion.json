Most people dryly list all of the languages and frameworks and technology stacks they have experience with, sometimes even in a freakin' table in a Word doc... (I used to do that...)\n\nIf you want to stand out, there is nothing stopping you from making your resume (truthfully) narratively driven rather than data driven.  You can even put easter eggs in your resume and see who notices them for a bit of connective fun (more on this later)\n\n*From Real Life:*\n> I cannot tell you how overwhelmingly positive my resume became received after I transformed the first page to an actual 3 part narrative chronicled story of my experience over the last 10+ years.\n> \n> I took a massive risk (I thought) in re-writing my resume to include an Act 1, Act 2 and Act 3 on page one, with subtitles!\n> \n> I took an even bigger risk in making the subtitles for each act the lyrics to \"A Whole New World\" from Aladdin, which just happened to be playing in my head as I was writing the story of my experiences and journey narratively.\n> \n> I honestly never thought people would respond so positively to this kind of resume, I was just allowing myself to be a bit off the wall but respectful to the truth of my experiences and without being overly silly.\n> \n> What I learned from getting feedback about my resume is just how much it stood out over other resumes.  The narrative first page still listed all of the frameworks, languages, and tech stacks I commonly work with today and other specific details like that from the last 10+ years, but it was framed in such a way which felt human *(as I was told)*.\n> \n> The people whole recognized the Aladdin easter egg LOVED it, but the one thing I heard the most from literally everyone, recruiters over the phone, interviewers, and even random people on LinkedIn who happened to find me and read it, is just how much my resume stands out because it's written in a refreshing and unique way.\n\nI really liked learning how well my resume resonates with people now.  It's rather fun, even if I didn't go forward with a company, I did get a lot of first calls and conversations because a lot of people were just curious to talk to me (again, so I was told many times).\n\nIf I'm going to make a prediction about the nature of stand out resumes, it's that there is massive opportunity which no one is expressing in creating a narrative structure over a dry table of tool experience.",

Also, what I write here are direct observations and impressions gained from my recent experience of aggressive job seeking/interviewing for 4 months straight, leading to one of the best jobs I've ever had (so far)\n\n**\"Pro-Tip\" the First:** If you do nothing else, and if you really like the company you've interviewed for, write them a personal and specifically detailed thank you letter (describing how much of a positive impact the interview had and what the conversations meant to you (upon reflection)).\n\nThis is kind of a commonly heard one, but probably not as well practiced one, but there is a caveat to consider.\n\nOnly write a thank you letter if the company and the type of work you would be doing is very meaningful to you personally.\n\n*From Real Life:*\n> After 3 months, I finally found two companies building automation software which affects and controls real world systems.  For the last 10+ years, I've just worked at whatever software company because the fit and pay was decent, but I wouldn't say I was \"inspired\" at work daily.  It was until I interviewed with these two companies, that I realized exactly the kind of field(s) of work I wanted to work in.  I felt like a kid again, excited about the prospect of working on systems which actually control real world physical things, not just boring old enterprise software.\n> \n> I told this to the recruiter I was working with, and she immediately said, \"OMG!  Write a thank you letter right now and say exactly how you feel, thanking them for the opportunity to talk to them and what your revelation about the kind of work you're only interested in doing now as a result of the interview conversation.\"\n> \n> So I did exactly that.  It felt silly at first, a bit naked (in the British sense of the word), but I got a call back the next day saying they loved and appreciated the thank you letter and that they wanted to move forward with me.\n> \n> I found out later that the thank you letter was a massive contributor to pushing me well beyond the competition I was facing for the position in terms of standing out.  My letter was very sincere and honest, and I was told that this level of realism was a big help.\n\nA bit long winded of a Pro-Tip, but it's honestly one of the most important I've encountered for getting all the way through the interview process and landing the gig.\n\nThe final caveat to this \"Pro-Tip\" is, make sure you actually really want to work for the company you're writing a thank you latter to, make it personal and real, and don't be afraid of expressing positive revelations if you have them from the interview process.",

Let me begin by saying this guy sent the message at 4:59, the last minute of the day. I felt like that was a coward move. Then goes on to state \"you were fantastic.....you will do great whatever you do.\" Hmmm yeah? Then why didn't I get the role if you believe I was fantastic and great at what I do? Like that's a hypocritical statement which makes him seem like even more of a coward.

Even 1 who secured a position after a udemy course, I am also told it's quite easy to secure a coding position right now as there is high demand due to skills shortage (probably due to low immigration).\n\nHowever, I was also told on another platform today that I could not hope to get a coding position, junior or otherwise even with 1 year of self study, so I'm hearing mixed messages..

Not sure how well it goes with other things. Bue due to its more clean architecture approach it should be better compatible with every other way to establish API too. Django locks you into being REST API only (or rendering HTML). Although fair to say that Django Channels project exist to make Web socket stuff with Django too, and GraphQL stuff exists for Django too. Ergh, it is more code architecture difference than availability of ways to expose it",

Many people struggle to learn on their own without someone to guide them. \n- Uni gives kids a chance to grow up a bit before entering the workforce. 18 year olds who've never lived alone before and who have never needed to set their own schedules or cope with unlimited freedom tend to make some really poor decisions, and it's a whole lot nicer to figure out who you are and how to cope with responsibility amongst a group of people your own age who are going through the same experience, rather than amongst a group of older workers in industry. Not to mention that people who haven't yet gone to uni tend to drastically underestimate how much more learning and growing up those who have gone were able to pack into those 4 years.",

        "content": "> i just started thinking about the advice repeated here time and time... \"degree make it easier\" is the tldr of it.  i ask myself, but why?\n\nThere's a ton of different reasons. Off the top of my head:\n\nFrom the point of view of a business hiring juniors:\n- Degrees from accredited institution serve as guarantees from a 3rd party that you've learned a common curriculum up to some acceptable minimum standard.\n- Because CS degrees from any institution teach basically the same stuff, a company hiring juniors knows exactly what stuff they _don't_ need to teach the new junior themselves.\n- A degree signifies that your interest isn't just a passing whim, and that you're able to devote significant time and effort over time towards your goals. When someone young is trying to apply for a job as a software developer without having gotten a degree, at least some employers will take that as a signal that they were looking for a shortcut.\n\nFrom the point of view of benefits to the student:\n- Degrees expose you to opportunities for internships, teaching assistant positions, research positions, and other things that help expose you to new areas that might interest you, and help you to break into the world of work.\n- Your classmates from your degree program will form your first professional network, giving you people who you can compare notes against about what different companies are like, who pays well, who's hiring, and so on.\n- Degrees give you time to learn the material, and a peer group to learn it with, and access to resources (TAs, professors) to help you learn it. Trying to learn data structures and algorithms on your own in your free time after working a 40 hour week sounds much tougher than trying to complete it during university.",

Even if they work for 20 years before retiring and it takes 5 years to level up to senior, you'd expect 75% of workers to be senior, give or take, which means you'd expect around 75% of positions to be senior.

The issue is it uses a proprietary stack (old healthcare systems). I ended up accepting just because I wanted to avoid going into debt and they offer tuition assistance so I can go to school part time and finish up my bachelors from here. I have about 45 credits remaining (15 credits a semester, 2 semesters a year). At this position I will be working on tooling/infrastructure so stuff like creating/maintaining internal APIs, fixing errors or adding features to internal tooling, so on.\n\nI now have a few competing priorities.\n\n1. Finish my BS CS\n2. Build up a portfolio in a better stack i.e. MERN\n3. Get good at interviewing (behavioral/leetcode)\n4. Do well at my actual job.\n\nIt seems like staying in this position long term would not be ideal for my career, so my current plan is to build up a decent portfolio in MERN, continue working on interviewing, and do well enough at my actual job before hopping in a year. I am not sure if finishing my BS would really benefit me short term since I'll have a year of software development experience, even if in the proprietary stack. I also met a few people with no degree at all who are getting FAANG interviews but I'm not sure if that's normal.\n\nAny advice for which things to prioritize from here? I'd like to stay in full stack or back-end web development but I'm open to learning about stuff like k8s, aws, so on.",

The further away you are from being that ideal candidate, the less likely you are to be hired for that role. But, at the same time, the company _wants_ to fill the position, so they'll often pick someone who isn't perfect for a role, rather than allowing that role to sit open. You don't have to be a perfect candidate, just closer to it than the other candidates.",

Don\u2019t see other programmers as competitors but as sources of knowledge. Trust me it works. Sure a lot of other programmers might behave like competitors because they compare themselfs to you and comment. But don\u2019t give in those discussions and focus on learning and improving. Failing is also winning sometimes even if it does not feel like that. And any internship is valuable, the big companies don\u2019t always have all the best environments for work. Do your research online on companies and how they work internally. You will not program 40 hours a week, I can guarantee that. You other skills will matter aswell. Good communication is one of them. Explaining your code to non tech people is a skill and highly in demand.",

You have been sitting with this issue for 2 weeks now. The problem is that your scheduler has some configuration settings that need to be shared between threads, these settings can be  updated during execution of a report. You somehow can't seem to get the threads to refresh the cached configuration settings. You put your headphones on when you arrived with your coffee and start researching, history repeats itself. Someone somewhere has had this exact issue or something similar, you need to find it. Test it. You look up from your monitor, and see that the building is empty. It's 19:00, and you need to move, your health system (off-time job) client is awaiting functionality to test from home. You haven't started yet, you gather your gear and move to your car, at least by now traffic looks better, and it takes you 1 hour to get home.

Candidate solves it and submits, fully automated round. leetcoding deserves only being automated\nThis step is purely to weed out non programmers technically.\n==============\nstep another one:\nWriting specifically bad code, that breaks any possible rules of clean code. Just ask candidates to refactor it. You will see already a lot. Including making it with injections/testable/how they name stuff and structure it.\nYou will see literally all skills of a middle ranked software developer during it. How well he writes, refactors code and understands how to have it testable and etc.\n==============\nstep another one:\nprepare list of self assement for all kind of categories / fields possibly to know related to this profession. Ask candidate to perform self assesment on a scale from 1 - 5\nwith a grade system like this\n```\nGrade-scale instruction:\n\n* ? or 0: No experience\n* 1: Junior (I have some experience or know some theory)\n* 2: Strong Junior\n* 3: Middle\n* 4: Strong Middle (I can perform well, I know the best practices)\n* 5: Senior (I know more than enough)\n```\nDuring conversation with candidate, you can ask questions, and finding at least in 2-3 fields exact his level. All other fields would be known to you from candidate based... on assumption, that candidate basically filled answers in proportional scale. You will quite full picture of all his skills, by checking just 2-3 sections exactly.\n=====\nAnd...",

So you should be aware of that, if my NDA is 'forever' but they only have grounds to enforce it for lets say 2 years, then anything beyond that in reality is irrelevant because it's invalid.

Django enforces its own architecture, which any dev is forced to use in it. Kind of really encouraging spaghetti a bit and hard readability due to code jumping all over Django reserved names. We can say that as advantage -> Django enforces consistency through its own architecture enforced. Which is advantage around low skill devs. Plus Django Admin feature is nice to make moderator GUI tool without any effort almost. So... Django is kind of necessary evil serving its usage cases. For rapid development, low time to live solutions among low skills devs.\n\nSo FastAPI i think indeed the best choice.",

It is not really a path of a professional though. CMS are really low paid solutions. Extremely low just to be sure.\nin my third world country: software devs started with 400$ per months as juniors and can grow to 3-4 and higher thousands of dollars per month salary (potentially can reach 10 thousands of dollars per month and further)\nWordpress solutions were worthy of only being paid something like from 50$ (one-two landing pages) to 1000$ at maximum (e-commerce shop) per project and competion was obviously ridiculous for no code solutions. Average price for projects in wordpress was around 50-150$ Obviously not really reliable income since a high income of clients is necessary and high reputation at some freelancing platform / enough made marketing. Technically should be still possible to gather per month some nice income.\n\nOr seeking other options where your strengths are.",

I have since decided to give python a go which I love and plan to stick with from here on out. I am not in the tech industry so I can't say first hand how \"in-demand\" it is here, though a friend of my wife recently secured a position paying 80k after doing a only a udemy course (not the only example), the local government (state) is also running programs to help people transition into tech (free bootcamps + guaranteed internships etc) to help get people into the industry.\n\nAs I work full time I am on no such program though I spend my time outside of work studying. There are many junior web dev positions advertised that require minimal experience, I'm just not sure what would be equivalent barrier to entry wise if I want to stick with Python.",

I program about 45-50% of the day, but it's in this niche pocket of industry. I also have gained familiarity in writing documentation, QA software testing, and Azure. It's been 4.5 years here, I am only 24, and wondering if there is any upward mobility at this company (there isn't really). It's mid-sized, not sure if there are over 1,000 employees or not. I landed this job when I was 20 because of my GPA and previous job experiences. I essentially went into the workforce when I was 15.  As of now, my interests and skill crossover is pulling me toward data analytics. I can grasp the concepts, but I've always been terrible at math, so I don't know if I'd be able to compete with collegiate graduates. Most of the programming I do is string manipulation. Also, I do plan on going to college at WGU or something, I guess I am just wondering if anyone knows the job market trajectory for Python analysts VS. developers.",

I feel like i go slower, and yet i gain also experience i would not probably normally gain.\nAnd may be i just reached stuff where each thing is a bit harder to climb.\nI compensate with having good learning during weekends, and sometimes also going in self education during evenings of workdays\ni find the speed more or less acceptable then\n\nMy learning is divided into sometimes learning theory, sometimes doing just practical tasks / pet projects. It depends on when i feel more lacking in which field. Switching from time to time.\n\nI would not mind getting a job where i own all processes from zero.

The reason why is that the younger generations think that oil and gas is a deeply rooted evil. This has a significant effect because it is shaping how fresh grads invest in retirement portfolios, and affects the ability for a company to issue things such as corporate bonds to earn money (generate liquidity on demand really). There is an extremely large negative stigma and we have massive financial incentives to do everything we can to reduce that perception because it is affecting our daily trading volume in a measurably detrimental way.\n\nFurthermore, many new grads simply think that oil and gas is a dying field and they will be rendered obsolete within years. Regardless of what one may think about the industry, that is just not true. But it does has a deep effect that at the University I went to/lectured at, our oil and gas/petroleum engineering specialties went from some of our most popular majors to a program we terminated 3 years ago because the most recent graduating class was like 2 people, down from maybe 50? 100? I don't know the exact numbers. The combination of the two factors greatly reduce the hiring pool.",

There is only a problem that some stuff can be not chosen due to some sort of problems.

It is kind of bad to rely that much on frameworks, and ideally solution is made in as much separation as possible from it, while utilizing framework only as a layer to expose endpoints / and to set input/output at them, but you get the idea. Sometimes people still choose having architecture fully polluted by every possible implementation of django for example. In this case it is better to have people who are as much as possible familiar with it, if they are long time post point of no return.\nP.S. and this roadmap is not mentioning FastAPI at all,, despite it being trending popular choice in jobs nowdays, and mentioning a dozen of others",

Pulumi and AWS CDK are interesting that in comparison to terraform which uses HCL its own language, Pulumi and AWS CDK allow to use regular programming languages, which allows less mind blowing tricks to make in order to program what you wish in terms of infra. There is still high beauty in terraform due to it being specifically made declarative language just for this job, it is highly consistent. And has super wide support among all cloud providers.",

Everything is configured in the UI, which makes it hard to see/approve changes, things are live straight away so any larger changes can break things while you play around with them to see if they will work (as oppose to testing them in a branch first). They where designed to run agents directly on servers which bloated after a while with every tool ever single pipeline needed. Different versions of packages meant to needed different agents and managing it all is a huge pain. Often java focused and everything else is a second class citizen. This also goes for other older tools like teamcity, stash etc. Jenkins is also plugin hell, everything is a plugin and you need a whole bunch to make it a useable tool these days. Which increases the learning curve and makes the whole thing a mess.\n> I would not use a first gen CI system any more. They should just be left to die. They have tried to tack on more modern features but have all done it badly to keep support for the older ways of doing things.\n> Second gen CI systems are all config first, where the config is in the repo next to the code. As well as Docker (or at least ephemeral VMs for each job) so the agents are kept clean and essentially reset after each job and each job can install the tools it needs for that job. This includes things like travis, circle ci, github actions, gitlab ci, drone ci etc... so many choices there is no reason to use the legacy tools any more.\n> I think there is also a third gen popping up now - more abstract than just CI and starting to go down general workflow pipelines. Often kube focused and while you can build CI/CD systems out of them they are more general and no longer tied to only being triggered by Git event but rather any event. This includes things like Tekton, Argo Wrokflows etc type tools.",

A year a startup can spend just on estimating their business strategy without having anything done yet.\nQuestions should be asked if they have already profit, and how it increased from previous quarter of year. How many users/clients they have at this moment and how their amount increased from before. If the answers are zero, then with around 95% chance a startup can die even without reaching Minimal Viable Product. Even if they answered non zero answers, they are always different factors that could lead to their death within current year. But it is already much more promising.\n\nBut. In any case, they are still a perfect opportunity for software developers to increase their skills. Just don't agree to get paid in company shares or something resembling it, only in cash per month / hour. Your payment strategy contract should be as transparent as possible, and you would be good then.\nOh yeah, my startup offered to me also to have good salary only when they would hit the market. That's kind of falls into this 95% of failure too. Don't agree to any future salaries. Salary should be only up to date with your current skills. If you get underpaid more than in half from your current marketing value and there no really perspective to have it fixed except with really distant and unreliable salary promises, better to start getting interviewed and looking for new job.\nA right estimation of your current marketing value can be achieved only with getting at least several offers from other companies, where you passed all stages of interviews though. (Even this estimation has a level unaccuracy because it is fully verified only once you pass a trial period of 3 months (usually this amount if standard))\n\nWell, and obviously charisma and luck can get you salary way more than what for you have skills. Which makes some disbalance into this estimation as well. In those cases you are highly likely to fail trial period though.",

For our purposes, when we get a new system we must install an OS, register each system to the testing software, apply a bunch of settings/properties to it, then register it on another internal service with similar, if not the same, information.\n\nI got pretty tired of installing an OS and inputting all the information on our UI over and over across hundreds of systems, so I began to look into how I might be able to automate the process.  I ended up building a Flask application that uses Ansible to run a playbook using the webform data as variables to install the OS and run the Python automation I created communicating between the API's. (Both programs that we use have an accessible REST API). Authentication to the program was done via LDAP credentials and authentication to the API's it's connecting to is done by asking for API keys upon login, then checking those are valid.\n\nAfter building this program I realized I want to start working towards a software development career. I feel I understand Python/OOP pretty well, but as of now I don't have a public portfolio, as this program I've built I'm unable to share the source code or any pictures of it according to a confidentiality agreement I signed when I got hired.\n\nI want to start doing freelance work or try to get a remote position somewhere, should I include this program in a resume? I feel that having a written description would be a terrible way to try and show an employer what I'm capable of doing.\n\nOne obvious solution would be to create a program that I make to be my \"show off\" program, public with source code available, but I'm not a creative person so I don't have many ideas for that unfortunately. Does anyone suggest where I should go from here? Should I continue to try and think of a project, or should I just try to recreate something that's already been made? Feeling pretty stuck here, any advice would be appreciated",

The exploitation of asteroids could potentially solve poverty and if poverty is solved we can grow more as a society also More job opportunities which brings the nation and the world forwards, Most of Taxes for right now will go into NASA and Technological Research (as an investment) instead of a whopping 1.92 trillion U.S. dollars (as of 2019) into the military, Putting money into the military is not helping our top priorities (Poverty, unemployment), Space exploration (Going to different cellestial bodies i.e The moon and Mars) on the other hand will solve multiple different problems (giving that we exploit the resources from asteroids we could easily build structures and bases) that we humans may face in the near future such as, Climate change, Ecological Collapse, Overpopulation and Global pandemics, Therefore concluding that the only way to make a perfect society is if we advance.",

I think your main difficulty is gonna be the fact that software is not your company's main product, but just a tool you use internally.  So, they will view software development as a \"cost\" rather than as a profit-generating activity.  So you will have an uphill battle convincing them they should make any changes to a working system.\n\nBut I agree with you that they should at least use source control and get away from this copy-pasting files nonsense...you should be able to easily argue the cost benefit of proper source control.  Make it clear that you don't want to rewrite rewrite anything, but just want to set them up so that the whole system is easier (and cheaper) to maintain.  Take your time to do some research into some good arguments to present, that will illustrate the savings they will make over time by having things properly in `git`.  For bonus points, try to anticipate some of the concerns they may have about making the switch.",

This is mostly just more API calls but also needs a custom \"go do it like a user\" because the platform doesn't have an api to do what we need. (hacks in prod!)\n\nThe deployment is built out in CircleCI and an in-house terragrunt/terraform deployment platform. So additional languages include sql, terraform config, circleCI config, a pinch of bash for the CI shell script, and a tiny-tiny touch of Go to make the terragrunt magic work. \n\nAll wrapped under the misleading job description of \"software engineer\". :D",

After some considerable thinking I aimed to play to my strengths as much as possible and focus my time and effort towards constructing presentable, complex, and applicable software-centric projects. \n\nThis past summer month, I have taken Grade 12 English over the summer and after fully reconciling with my mistake, I believed reaching out to fully understand the consequences of my actions was necessary. \n\nWith that I have a few questions in relation to courses I believe, could have positively impacted me but due to external factors such as availability and present knowledge I couldn\u2019t fully pursue these beliefs.\n\n1.    If I did not take Grade 11 or Grade 12 Chemistry, does this show anything negatively about me?\n2.    If I took Grade 12 English over the summer, does this truly negatively impact me, and so much so that it could make or break my application?\n3.    Moreover, does summer school negatively impact me a lot?\n\nThank you, Waterloo. Please assume every course I relate to is University level.\n\nI would love any advice I could get, as this is an important time for many others like me and striving for a school such as yours is an honor. **NOT SPAM ACTUALLY HELP PLZ**",
